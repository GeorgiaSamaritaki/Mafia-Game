The project is an adaptation of the multiplayer card game Mafia on a smart environment consisting of a Tv, an interactive Wall, an augmented table and smart-devices such as smartphones or/and tablets in Angular. Because the game runs in multiple screens, it can be replicated locally with three browser tabs while players can sign up using their phone. 

You can take a look at how the game looks in the [presentation](/presentation.pdf). Find our report [here](/ReportEng.pdf)

The game rules are followed as described on: [Mafia Game Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game))

Find the mockups of the game here: [Mockups in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/hJOqUHQTfSK97286jCT4t8/Mockups-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1&t=jlcjxiaqCZmqm2m3-1)

Developped on our 4th year at University of Crete for our bachelors in Computer Science under the supervision of the Ami Department of Forth Institute of Technology during the course of HY469-Modern Topics in HCI, using the provided template for the course.
